debgo
======

dpkg-like functionality for building debs & source packages in Go.

**Warning: debgo [is being renamed to 'debber'](https://github.com/debber), Please note that the this version should still be used until debber-v0.3 becomes stable. It will not receive updates after that point. Ta**

Introduction
------------

debgo can be used to produce 3 types of artifact:

 * The 'Binary debs' - per-architecture `.deb` packages, usually containing compiled artifacts..
 * The 'source packages' - a .dsc file plus 2 archives. Contains sources and build information.
 * The '-dev' package - a `.deb` file, usually containing sources only. These are commonly used as build dependencies. For go dependencies, I recommend using the -dev.deb.

debgo has extra features for packaging 'go' applications, but in theory it could be used for various other tools.

*Note that Binary debs should normally be built from source debs. But, for Go programs in particular it's really convenient to skip this step - especially when cross-compiling. The reason for this is because the Go cross-compiler is very straightforward, whereas the standard dpkg toolchain is not portable AFAIK.*

Libary usage
------------

Once the API firms up, the preferred way to use debgo will be as a library. It should become most useful as part of a build system.

Please see [godoc](http://godoc.org/pkg/debgo/) for API docs.

#### The deb package

`deb` is the core tooling for generating debian packages (source or binary). This offers all the flexibility (e.g. in theory it can parse more packages than those generated by `debgen`), but it's pretty basic.

#### The debgen package

`debgen` offers a more involved (but opinionated) package generation system. It employs a templating system to help with generating metadata files and so-on.


Commandline usage
-----------------

You can use debgo from the commandline, but there is no configuration - just flags.


### Basic commands

debgo comes with a few basic commands for building Debian packages. For the most part, each takes the same arguments.

`go get debgo/cmd/...`

 * debgo-deb produces .deb files for each architecture
 * debgo-source produces 3 'source package' files.
 * debgo-dev produces one '-dev.deb' file

goxc
----

goxc is a build tool with packaging (and cross-compiling) features. This code was derived from the goxc project, which itself will shortly use debgo instead of its own code. 
As soon as the switch is made, it will also gain more options for .deb creation (additional files, scripts, etc).

Scope and warnings
------------------

 * debgo should be able to generate reasonably complex packages, including patches and so-on.
 * BUT it doesn't provide specific support for various features. It doesn't parse scripts such as postinst or 'rules' files.
 * debgo *currently* only supports .tar.gz archives. It will soon support .tar & .bzip files, and hopefully lzma2 (depending on library availability)
 * Validation is primitive for the time-being
 * The default files generated for READMEs and changelogs are just placeholders. You should really generate these files yourself.
